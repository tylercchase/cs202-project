# Epic Fish Fighting Game
An epic fish fighting game for my UAF CS202 final project

The idea started out as a standard "Fishing Game" and then the idea evolved into a competitive game where one player controls a group of fish and one player controls a fishing boat trying to catch all of the fish.

# Gameplay

The game can played with either a keyboard or two controllers

The controls are WASD for the fish and IJKL for the fisherman

The player starts on the start menu which describes these controls.
